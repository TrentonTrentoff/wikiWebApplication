# Wiki Web Application

A version of a wiki-like encyclopaedia, utilisng Django as a web framework and Python back-end, reading/writing local files written in Markdown, which then utilises a [Markdown-to-HTML](https://github.com/trentm/python-markdown2) module to convert back to HTML. The web application offers the users to create new pages, edit existing pages (which will load the initial markdown content), and can also load a random page as well.
